# My first Milestone project - L S H Electricians

## Welcome! 

### This site was built using [GitHub Pages] (https://pages.github.com/)/.

#### This website provides information on an electrical service for Domestic and Commercial clients.  
#### We provide a range of services covering all your electrical needs.
#### This website demonstrates the services we provide and enables you to book a call out or request a quote.

## UX

### Strategy

#### This website is for owners of properties, residential or commercial who are looking to repair or update their electrics.
#### I want to provide a service that is easy to navigate. 
#### Making it clear and quick to provide information and request a service.

### User Story 1

#### I found myself constantly searching for a qualified electrician online but was unsure of what to ask for. I wanted to know did they meet all safety standards and was the work guaranteed.

### User Story 2

#### I needed an electrician for an emergency call out.  I wanted to find someone fast, efficient and reliable – quickly.

### User story 3.

#### We needed a qualified electrician to check our electrics and certify them all for insurance purposes.
#### I want to be able to go onto a website and leave with progress step.

### Scope.

#### Essentials will include

•	Call out
•	Emergency
•	Insurance
•	Guarantee

### Skeleton:

#### I have used Balsamique to draw up 3 page wireframes for Mobile, iPad and Desktop.
#### I will design the website to adjust to differents sized screens to ensure optimum viewing.
#### I will make sure all links are active and working.

### Surface:

#### I will use the colors 

- Gold
- Grey

#### My Header and footer will use the two main colors

 - Gold
 - Grey

### Typography

#### I will use the following fonts throughout the website for consistency in style.
 * Roboto
 * Exo
 * Sans Serif as a back up
